Engineering Systems Summits are designed to introduce the different practices and tools used at large companies and share learnings and innovation.
For most of us, remote and hybrid work are here to stay, and software development and software engineering will change significantly as we move to hybrid. How we work together, how we build and sustain our products, the tools we use, when and how we use them, and more.

We’d like to bring together representatives from engineering system teams across the industry in late October of this year to explore how the technologies, processes and culture of work are evolving to tackle hybrid and remote-first work. We’ll be centering the talks on three questions: What changed? What problems surfaced? What are we doing to mitigate the identified problems?

We propose splitting the day into two sections: In the morning, companies present research related to different facets of remote work. In the afternoon, we’ll focus on findings and demos of work teams have already built/deployed.

To start the conversation, we’ve brainstormed a few topics for you to react to:
1. The unique challenges of onboarding in a remote-first or hybrid environment. 
   * Onboarding engineers: How do facilitate new employees establishing relationships and getting plugged in? How to replace the hallway conversations?
   * How do engineering system teams drive creation and adoption of good quality docs in a virtuous manner?

2. Adapting to an asynchronous work culture
   * A-synchronous working: How do you use tools and processes to facilitate this?
   * Adjustments to how we're working. How do we adjust our work culture and fit our engineering processes to this?
3. In a hybrid environment, how do teams ensure that remote workers aren’t sidelined?

# We want to hear from you
What are you interested in learning more about? What topics would you like to give a talk on?
